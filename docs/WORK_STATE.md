# RTAFNC Good Deed — Public Work State

> Public repository documentation is code-only. Personal data, student identifiers, Telegram chat identifiers, callback identifiers, credentials, live incident evidence, screenshots containing personal data, and operational secrets must remain in private institutional storage.

## Security Incident Containment — 2026-09-21

Status:

- Telegram bot API token: revoked by owner.
- Telegram account: two-step verification enabled by owner.
- Telegram integration in emergency branch: disabled.
- Legacy Telegram polling/listener: disabled.
- Legacy local API mode: disabled.
- Production write gate: disabled.
- Legacy unauthenticated password read/write routes: retired.
- Replacement Telegram token: **not approved for runtime use yet**.
- Cloudflare migration: separate staging work; no production merge/cutover from this incident branch.

Recovery conditions before Telegram can be enabled again:

1. Audit active Telegram account sessions and terminate unknown sessions.
2. Remove old Telegram credentials from every runtime secret store and host environment.
3. Confirm no browser/frontend source contains provider secrets.
4. Use one owner-controlled server-side secret store for the replacement token.
5. Test with a controlled canary configuration before restoring production notification.
6. Keep bot group/channel privileges at least privilege.

## Current Architecture Direction

- Public browser code contains no provider secrets.
- Authentication and authorization move to server-side RTAFNC ONE Core.
- LINE ID tokens are verified server-side.
- Student Master linkage is owner-controlled and deny-by-default.
- Cloudflare Pages is the intended static frontend.
- Cloudflare Worker is the intended security gateway.
- D1/Core stores only minimum identity/session/RBAC metadata.
- Authoritative Good Deed records remain in private institutional backend storage until an approved migration.
- Evidence and personal media remain private and are never published to GitHub Pages.

## Public Repository Rules

Do not commit:

- student names, IDs, cohort rosters, contact details or health data;
- Telegram bot tokens, chat IDs, webhook keys or callback identifiers;
- LINE Messaging API secrets or access tokens;
- passwords, password exports, password sheets or temporary credentials;
- Google service account credentials, private keys or `.env` files;
- database exports, backup data, evidence files or production logs.

Allowed public content is limited to source code, synthetic test fixtures, sanitized schemas, documentation without personal data, and security controls.

## Operational Notes

Historical live-test details were intentionally removed from this public file. Required audit evidence should be stored in a private Drive/audit location with access limited to authorized personnel.

Production changes must follow:

Plan → Review → Security Gate → Staging → Controlled E2E → Owner Approval → Production.

**PRODUCTION WRITE = FALSE during incident containment.**

## Local recovery verification — 2026-09-22

Merged upstream containment through `5f4ef3d0`. Preserved all emergency gates. Removed two embedded LINE credential literals from the duplicate legacy backend and disabled its unauthenticated handlers. Suppressed raw provider exceptions in V2 logs. Provider revocation is reported by the owner in upstream documentation, not independently verified here. Replacement token location remains unresolved.

Token rotation procedure: `docs/TOKEN_ROTATION_20260922.md`. No production deployment, credential installation, or notification was performed. Full-repository PII findings remain under review; changed-file guard is not proof of a clean history.

Verification after reconciliation: syntax passed; 156 JavaScript and 23 Python tests passed. Replaced stale tests importing removed Telegram runtimes with assertions that the retired files remain absent, and verified V2 containment performs no credential access or provider call. Read-only Telegram canary stopped with missing `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (exit 2); live bot operation remains unverified.
